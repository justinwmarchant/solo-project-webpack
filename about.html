    <h1>Well, because...</h1>

    <p>Time is your most valuable resource. Once that resource depletes, so does everything that makes life worth living. Most people spend well more than half of their time either sleeping or working, and every second spent is a second you can't get back. Increasing your income, controlling your expenses, paying attention to your savings rate...these are the ways to regain as much time as possible. </p>
    <p>Mortality is scary. Use that fear to motivate you. Scary and depressing and uncomfortable as it may be, you're better off knowing that your time is limited.</p>
